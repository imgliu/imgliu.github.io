I have been working on planetary mapping since my research study at HKPolyU in 2014. My works focus on photogrammetry and Shape-from-Shading (a.k.a. photoclinometry) for high-res Lunar and Martian mapping. I also work on topics related to Small bodies mapping, planetary photometry and atmospheric dust on Mars. I had the chance (as a PhD student and as a postdoc, at HKPolyU) to participate in China’s Chang’E-4 and Tianwen-1 lunar and Mars missions, where I helped with high-res topo-mapping for landing site assessment. I am fascinated by how images help us make better sense of our environment and make our lives better. I am interested in ways to understand the Earth and her celestial neighbours, and their implications to shaping our future. My current directions include planetary mapping techniques, planetary photometry, and their scientific applications.<br><br>IEEE, IEEE GRSS Member; ISUI Member; RICS Student Member.</td></tr>
